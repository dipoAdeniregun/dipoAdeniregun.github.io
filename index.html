                    <h3>Real Time Heartrate Monitor</h3>
                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>This project aims to accurately determine a user's heartrate in real time using just a webcam. The user covers the camera lens of a webcam with their finger and this video
                        along with some signal processing techniques is used to infer the user's heartrate.
                    </p>
                    <p>The human heartrate typically ranges from 40 to 230 beats per minute or with a frequency of 0.667 to 3.833 Hz. By applying a band pass filter with
                        these cutoff frequencies, we can isolate the user's approximate heartrate.
                    </p>
